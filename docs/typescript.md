# Typescript

## Overview
TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers classes, modules, and interfaces to help you build robust components. The TypeScript language specification has full details about the language. Checkout the [source](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/typescript/typescript-compiling) for more info about how to get started with Typescript installation

## **Documentation**
Checkout: https://www.typescriptlang.org/ The documentation is very well written. They also have sections for programmers coming from different background :D

There are some other crash courses worth checking out too [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahCwqrYpIuM) and [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBPrJSw7yQA)! (Psst, I learned how to use TypeScript from them)

### **Development**
1. My favorite IDE is Visual Studio Code. It integrates with `tsc` through their integrated task runner so you won't have to config much.

### **Ready?**
Let's head to `/typescript/startHere.ts` for the first step!
